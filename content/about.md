## About Me

I am<!--sse--> a second-year medical student at the
[National University of Malaysia (UKM)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Malaysia "Learn more about the National University of Malaysia (UKM).")
and<!--/sse--> an aspiring neurosurgeon. Ever since I learnt about
[Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface "Learn more about Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs).")
and [neurotechnology](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotechnology "Learn more about neurotechnology."),
I have sought to become a neurosurgeon subspecialised in functional and augmentative neurosurgery.

More innovations are becoming available for medical use as the field of neurotechnology experiences significant growth.
I aim to treat patients affected by neurological disorders through such technology.

Furthermore, I believe the brain is the final frontier of medicine.
Recent advancements in BMIs and implant technology are making the prospect of merging man and machine at the neural level increasingly viable.
I seek to advance this field as a neurosurgeon and guide it responsibly and ethically.
