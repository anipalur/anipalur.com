Last week, I had the incredible opportunity to serve as a panellist alongside
[Dr Nanthini Mageswaran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nanthini-mageswaran "View Dr Nanthini's LinkedIn profile.")
and Lim Qi Wei during the recent orientation camp for first-year medical students at the
[Faculty of Medicine, UKM](https://www.ukm.my/medicine/language/en/home-faculty-of-medicine-ukm "Learn more about the Faculty of Medicine, UKM.").
It was a truly rewarding experience to share my insights and advice on navigating the challenges of medical school.

Thank you to the Faculty of Medicine for inviting me and to all the faculty members for organising such an enriching event!
I am grateful for the chance to support the next generation of medical professionals.
Wishing all first-year medical students an exciting and fulfilling journey ahead!
