## Using GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/anipalur/anipalur.com/issues "Visit the GitHub Issues tab.") is the preferred channel
for bug reports and feature and enhancement requests.  
To learn more about creating issues, check out [GitHub's quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart#opening-a-blank-issue "Learn more about GitHub issues.").

Make sure to follow these general guidelines when using GitHub Issues:

- **Check for duplicates.**   
  Ensure your issue has not been raised before by using the search feature. Duplicate issues will be closed.
- **Be detailed and specific.**   
  Include as much information as necessary to describe your issue.  
  Make sure to use a clear and descriptive title!
- **Label your issue.**  
  Make use of the many [labels](https://github.com/anipalur/anipalur.com/labels "View all labels available for issues.") available for issues
  to categorise your issue.
  Some labels will be added to your issue by default.
- **Link *relevant* issues or pull requests.**  
  Feel free to [link other issues or pull requests][linking-issue-prs] related to your issue.
- **Consider whether your issue fits the scope of this project.**   
  Issues that concern the majority of users will be of priority!
